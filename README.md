#N-Body Simulation in Java

## Overview

This project involves implementing an N-Body Simulation in Java based on the assignment from the book's website. The simulation explores the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. Make sure to carefully read through the assignment details, including any additional comments and suggestions provided.

## Instructions

### Specific Tasks

1. **Create Java Project:**
   - Create a Java Project for this assignment.

2. **Set up Project Structure:**
   - Create two directories in your Eclipse project: `lib` and `resources`.
   - Download the `stdlib.jar` library file from the book's authors and copy it into the `lib` folder.
   - Configure the build path by right-clicking on Project3 in Eclipse, selecting Build Path > Configure Build Path..., and adding `stdlib.jar` under the Libraries tab.

3. **Download Resource Files:**
   - Follow the checklist for the N-Body Simulation to download necessary files from the COS 126 ftp site.
   - Copy these files into the `resources` directory created in step 2.

4. **Eclipse Setup:**
   - Although the project describes running the program from the command line, it's recommended to do the work in Eclipse.
   - Provide the name of the input file as a third command argument after the finishing time and time step, without using `<`.
   - Modify the provided `NBody.java` with extra code to open the specified file and use it as `StdIn`.


## Notes

- This project is an individual effort.

- Refer to the checklist for helpful tips on downloading from the COS 126 ftp site.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project3.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Eclipse.

3. Follow the specific tasks outlined above.

4. Run the program and simulate the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies.
